  IS UNIQUE
    Implement an algorithm to determine if 
    a string has all unique characters. 
  CHALLENGE
    What if you cannot use additional data structures?

  /* 
  CHECK PERMUTATION
    Given two strings, write a method to decide
    if one is a permutation of the other. 
  */

  /* 
  URLIFY
    Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20.'
    You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end
    to hold the additional characters, and that you are given
    the 'true' length of the string.

  /* 
  PALINDROME PERMUTATION
    Given a string, write a method to determine if it is
    a permutation of a palindrome. The palindrome does not
    need to be limited to just dictionary words.
  */
 palindromePermutation: (str) => {},

  /* 
  ONE AWAY
    Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
    one edit (or zero edits) away from each other. 
    Possible edits are:
    1. insert a character
    2. remove a character
    3. replace a character

 /*
 STRING COMPRESSION
  Implement a method to perform basic string compression 
  using the counts of repeated characters. If the "compressed"
  string would not become smaller than the original string,
  retrun the original string. You can assume the string only 
  contains: [a-z][A-Z].
