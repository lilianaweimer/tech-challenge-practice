# Tech Challenge Practice

This is where I am going to work through *Cracking the Coding Interview* and figure out solutions to the problems in it. This will be good practice for TDD and problem-solving. (I am basing this partially on projects from my time at the Turing School of Software & Design, particularly [Spaceport](https://github.com/lilianaweimer/spaceport)). The problems will be organized by chapter, one file per chapter. I am still (as of writing this) figuring out how I am going to structure the files themselves.

## Setup
1. clone this repository
2. run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. run `npm test` to run tests
