# Tech Challenge Practice

This is where I am going to work through *Cracking the Coding Interview* and figure out solutions to the problems in it. This will be good practice for TDD and problem-solving. (I am basing this partially on projects from my time at the Turing School of Software & Design, particularly [Spaceport](https://github.com/lilianaweimer/spaceport)). The problems will be organized by chapter, one file per chapter. The tests use Mocha and Chai. Each chapter is its own object, with the individual problems as properties. I am going to keep my solutions in their own branch, never merged to `main`.
